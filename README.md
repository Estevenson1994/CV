[Makers Academy Fellow](https://makers.tech/fellowship/) and MSci Chemistry Graduate, looking for my first job as a junior developer.

After graduating from university, I worked as a data analyst at a small technology start up, for one year. During my time there, I persuaded the CEO to pay for two of my colleagues and myself to attend the [Girls in Tech catalyst conference](https://girlsintech.org/catalyst-conference/). Unfortunately for him, this led me to the much needed, new and exciting adventure as a Makers Academy Fellow.

I am relishing the opportunity to grow and learn as I embark upon this journey. I am looking for a career where I can further develop my coding skills in a fast paced and challenging environment.
